Time taken:

Comments: 
-High cohesion, as everything deals with achievements.

-Coupled to the HUD, SoundManager, and ValueHolder. Fairly limited overall, and it's all necessary. 

-Conditionals are shallow

-Class is within 100 lines. Methods are within 30.

Suggested change:
-The interiors of the achievementKeeper.Add statements should be split off into an achievementMaker method.
