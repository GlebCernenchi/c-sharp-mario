Name of .cs file: HUD.cs

Comments:
-The class contains many properties and fields. Maybe this can be refactored

-At 100 lines, the class is near the limit in terms of size.

-Methods are within size.

-Identifiers make sense

-HUD knows about ValueHolder, StringHolder, Game, and SoundManager. Fairly limited coupling, as these are 
all part of the game's foundation

-LoadContent might be hurting cohesion.

Possible Change(s):
-Load the content in the constructor, and use the SpriteFactory to make the needed sprites.
