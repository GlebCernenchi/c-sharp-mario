•	Comment:	The code was is 61 lines and now is mostly viewable on one page. 
Code is coherent in that there are only 4 fields in the class, even so there may be some redundancy with 
the origin and position variables.  Also coherence of the ovder all project could be improved including the 
Mario class in the constructor instead of game class.  Finaly some of the limit values are hard coded  e.g. 
position.x < 200 which  could proveproblematic if the display scene dimension is changed.
