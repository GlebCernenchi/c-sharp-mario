Specific comments on quality of code:

- Appropriate amount of code. (around 74 lines)

- Low branching. (Single level if statements)

- High Cohesion: Very maintainable and easy to add and remove songs. Easy to load, play and stop songs with its two methods PlaySong and StopMusic. 
  Low complexity makes class easy to understand.

- Low Coupling: Takes in a game object in order to load music/sound content. All song loading, playing and stopping is contained within SoundMangager.  No other dependencies.
