Sprint number:		Sprint 4

Name of the .cs file:	JumpingState.cs

Author of the .cs file:	Tom Kiener

Time Taken to Review:	 7 minutes


Specific comments on quality of code:

- Appropriate amount of code. (around 38 lines)

- Low branching. (Single level if statements)

- High Cohesion: Mario's jumping logic is contained within the class, very maintainable
  and reduced complexity since Mario's physic state in the air is contained within the class.

- Minimal Coupling: JumpingState only depends on it's interface, IMarioPhysicsState.  It's Update
  method takes in a Mario object, however this is necessary in order to retrieve Mario's X and Y
  position, height, and velocity.

- Overall, JumpingState.cs is written well.
