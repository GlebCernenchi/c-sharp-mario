Sprint number:		Sprint 5

Name of the .cs file:	SoundManager.cs

Author of the .cs file:	Tom Kiener

Time Taken to Review:	 7 minutes


Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:

- Appropriate amount of lines of code (75 lines)
- Naming conventions are easy to understand
- SoundManager loads music files on initialization
- Consists of PlaySong and StopMusic method
- Since the names are understandable, it is easy to figure what both methods do.
- Possible Changes:
	o Methods PlaySong and StopMusic could be renamed (PlagSong & StopSong) or (PlayMusic & StopMusic) to be consistant
