Sprint Number: Four

Name of .csv File: Map.csv

Author of .csv File: John Chumley

Number of minutes taken to review: 2

Comments:

-John worked on the Map file this Sprint so I reviewed that

-Map is understandable with use of a .csv file because I can visualize the map

-Ground is clear and enemies are obviously labelled

-Naming convention for blocks with items could be done without needing more than one letter/symbol, but it works fine
