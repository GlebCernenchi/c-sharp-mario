Comments: 
(Some problems have been fixed in the submitted version)

-Unused field "factory".

-EnemyFireballCollide() code is calculating intersections between rectangles, then not using them. 

-Short methods, <30 lines, short class, <100 lines.

-Fairly limited coupling. The check to see if the block is a ground tile could be done a little better.

-High cohesion. Everything works toward the collision response of fireballs and other objects.
