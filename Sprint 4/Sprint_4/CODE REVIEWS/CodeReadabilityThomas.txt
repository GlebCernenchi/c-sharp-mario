Comments:

-The method EnemyFireballCollide does the same thing if intersection.Height > intersection.Width and the opposite.
The branching is clutter.

-The BlockFireballCollide does the same as above.

-Lines of code is small, making the class easy to read.

-Field declaration, constructor, and methods are well organized. Everything is in the right order.
