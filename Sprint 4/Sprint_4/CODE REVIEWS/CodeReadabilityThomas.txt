Comments:
-Properties and fields are correctly ordered. All of the names make sense

-The purpose of the countDuration and currentTime fields is vague. I'm not sure they're necessary

-All of the draw calls make sense, none use magic numbers. All of the ValueHolder names seem fair.

-Short class that is easy to read
